            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I obtained my PhD from University of British Columbia under the supervision of <a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~angel/" target = "blank">Prof. Omer Angel </a> and completed a Post-Doc in University of Cambridge under <a href="https://homepage.univie.ac.at/nathanael.berestycki/" target = "blank"> Prof. Nathanael Berestycki.</a>  Before that I obtained my Masters and Bachelors degree in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India.  </p>
            <h2> Research interests</h2>
            <p>I work broadly in the field of probability theory. In particular, I am mostly excited by problems originating in statistical mechanics and mathematical physics. I also dabble in combinatorics, ergodic theory and theoretical statistics from time to time. 
Most recently, I have been thinking about various random surface models which conjecturally have a conformally invariant scaling limits (which in most cases is the Gaussian free field). I am also interested in understanding the behaviour of various types of gradient models with hard core constraints.
In another direction, I am also interested in understanding whether a statistical mechanics model can be realized as a factor of iid and its various relations with the underlying geometry of the graph and the phase transition of the model.
In the past, I have worked in and around various aspects of random planar maps, Liouville quantum gravity and unimodular random graphs and uniform spanning trees. I also go back to these topics from time to time. </p>
